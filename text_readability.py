This utility leverages:
    -the textract module to scan docx, pdf, or other formats, into in-memory utf8 text
    -the natural languange toolkit (nltk) module to split text into a list of sentences
    -the readabilility module to analyze sentence list for readability metrics
The user will need to download each module+dependencies, and additionally, upon first use,
nltk will prompt user to download an additional 'punkt' natural language database.

Use:
    -assign file path/name to file variable
    -run to obtain Fresch Reading Ease and Kincaid Grade Level metrics for text
    
Notes:
    -other metrics are output from readability.getmeasures call
    -other natural language metrics likely give more complex assessments
    -user may want to quickly sanity check 'tokens' list prior to running and/or
     add other filters to code to remove spurious 'sentences' that could impact
     readbaility grades.
